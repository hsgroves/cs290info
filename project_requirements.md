#Final Project Requirements

##Non-negotiables
1. Your project must be a web app written using Ruby on Rails.
2. Your source code should be available as a public Github repository.
3. RSpec and RuboCop must be used in your application (more on these in a few weeks)

##Grading
- To get an **F**: Don't turn anything in, or turn something in that does not meet the above 3 requirements.
- To get a **D**: Turn something in that meets the requirements, but does not function for basic use cases.
- To get a **C**: Follow along in class, do the bare minimum, make a small app that works.
- To get a **B**: Make an app that runs smoothly, does a few things, and looks okay.
- To get an **A**: Go above and beyond and make something really cool.

In all cases, try not to leave any gaping security holes in your project. Doing so will almost definitely lead to a lower grade.

Some examples of "going above and beyond":
- Add nontrivial functionality
- Integrate with another application's API (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram... most services expose a developer API)
- Use more advanced HTML & CSS (whether done by you or through a CSS framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)) to make your app look amazing
- Use AJAX or a cool Javascript library (like d3.js, Three.js, Angular, React, etc) properly to create a more interactive site
- Deploy your site to a live server 
- Set up CI (Continuous Integration) for your tests

##Notes
All projects should be completed individually. Don't hesitate to ask others (strangers on the internet, classmates, or myself) for help - as long as you complete your own project. **No group projects will be accepted.** 

##Timeline
**02/02/16** - Send me a message on Slack with your proposal for your app. Include an outline of the functionality you'd like to include in your project and what models you think will make sense.

**05/17/16** (or before) - Turn your project in by posting a link to your project's GitHub repo in the `#final-projects` channel in Slack.
