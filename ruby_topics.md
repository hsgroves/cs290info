#Ruby Questions

If you're new to Ruby, here are some starting questions/topics that may be helpful to research.

- the difference between symbols and strings
- string interpolation
- object-oriented design in ruby: how to define class & instance methods, inheritance, etc
- `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, `attr_accessor` (not as often used within a Rails context, but important to know regardless)
- `yield` and what it does (if you have experience with Python, note that `yield` is *not* the same!)
- the difference between `&&` and `and`/`||` and `or` operators
- convention(s) for using '!' at the end of method names
- Modules vs Mixins vs Classes
- Blocks/Procs/Lambdas
- default access modifiers (public/protected/private) for instance methods and variables
- exception handling: in particular, familiarize yourself with `rescue Exception` and why to not do it (or how to properly do it)
- different types of hash syntax
