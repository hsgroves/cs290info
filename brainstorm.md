topics:
  start w/overview:
    - what is a web app vs. a web site
    - what is the development process
      - conception ($$)
      - prototype
      - feeedback
      - agile methodologies
      - staging/deployment
      - release
    - cool, but how do you actually do that?
    - programs aren't run from the command line or in BlueJ in real life
    - server intro/devops
    - "deploying"
    - configuring web servers: will get to it if we have time

  my expectations:
    - this is a one-credit course
    - entirely project based
    - i don't care about attendance
    - you will probably fail if you don't attend
    - i'll put in as much effort as you do
      - if you guys are learning and excited, i'll teach you whatever you want to learn
      - if you want an easy class, fine, but you won't learn anything useful
        - i'm okay w/that - it's easier for me to do less work!
        - literally the only person you're hurting if you don't put in effort is yourself

  steps you can take to prepare before the class:
    - get familiar with Ruby ()

  db basics
    - tables
    - SQL
    - design practices
    - relations
      - one to one
      - one to many
      - many to many
      - self-referential (?)
  - design
    - think about design first?
  - models
  - controllers
  - views
